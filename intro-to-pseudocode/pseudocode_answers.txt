SHORT ANSWER

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?

A: Programmers use pseudocode in brainstorming and developing functions and algoriths. It's a way to "talk out loud" in English-like statements what the developer's intentions are for the function(s) they're creating.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

A: The computer would not recognize the code as a language it is able to decipher, and therefore will not run.




PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

A:

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
FUNCTION printGreater with PARAMETERS first number, second number
IF first number is greater than second number
    PRINT "first number is greater"
ELSE IF first number is less than second number
    PRINT "second number is greater"
ELSE 
PRINT "first and second numbers are same"
END IF
END


2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

A:

FUNCTION printNumbers
BEGIN 
  num=100               // num to start at 100
WHILE (num >= 0)        // loop goes till num is greater than or equal to 0
  PRINT num
  num = num-1           // decrement 100 by 1
END WHILE
PRINT num
END


3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

A:


INPUT array of entries
FUNCTION findEntry with PARAMETER entry
FOR index = 0
    IF index of entries === entry
        PRINT "Found entry "+ entry
    ELSE IF no entry
        PRINT "Entry does not exist"
END FOR
END FUNCTION


4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

A:


var entires = ["Claire", "Derek", "Roscoe", "Mark", "Camela"];

function findEntry(entry) {
    for (let i=0; i < entries.length; i++) {
        if (entires[i] === entry) {
            return "Found entry " + entry;
        } else {
            return "Entry does not exist"
        }
    }
}
